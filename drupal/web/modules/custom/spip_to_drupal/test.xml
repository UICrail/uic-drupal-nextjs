        <texte><![CDATA[<p>On 5 September 2024, the Chair of the International Union of Railways (UIC), Dr Alan Beroud, who also serves as the CEO of Polish State Railways, met with the UIC Management Board to jointly discuss and define the key directions for the organisation’s development in the coming years. During the meeting, the significance of railways in the international transport system was emphasised, particularly in light of current geopolitical challenges and the growing need to modernise railway infrastructure.</p>
<p>The discussion focused on setting priorities that will shape UIC’s activities, including the development of technological innovations, strengthening sustainable development and enhancing operational safety standards. A shared vision was established, which highlights the importance of close regional cooperation and the ongoing pursuit of harmonising international technological and operational standards.</p>
<p>Key UIC initiatives and projects</p>
<p>1.	Technological innovations: UIC and the Board discussed the continued development of the FRMCS (Future Railway Mobile Communication System) project, which is a key element of future railway communication systems. This project aims to develop 5G specifications for rail to replace GSM-R networks.<br class='autobr' />
2.	Sustainable development: UIC is continuing its work on projects related to reducing CO2 emissions, including the implementation of renewable energy technologies such as hydrogen and batteries. As part of this area, an energy-saving task force has been established, which has collected best practices from over 70 UIC members.<br class='autobr' />
3.	Rail Vision 2030: A significant aspect of the strategy is supporting the Vision of Rail in 2030, which integrates new technologies into traditional solutions, encompassing eight multi-annual work programmes focused on improving railway capacity and service quality.<br class='autobr' />
4.	Operational safety: One of UIC’s priorities is raising operational safety standards, including the implementation of innovative solutions based on artificial intelligence for better risk management.</p>
<p>Railways in the geopolitical context</p>
<p>During the meeting, the UIC Board and Dr Alan Beroud also discussed the crucial role of railways in the global context. Rail, as a sustainable and safe mode of transport, plays an increasingly important role in the face of geopolitical challenges such as climate change and the need for stable supply chains. Strengthening the position of railways in international transport policy and modernising infrastructure are key elements of UIC’s strategy for the coming years.</p>
<p>The joint efforts of the Board and Dr Beroud aim to further strengthen UIC’s position as a platform for exchanging best practices and innovative solutions, which will shape the future of railway transport globally.</p>]]></texte>

        <texte><![CDATA[<p>Register now for the UIC Serious Gaming Day on 10 October 2024<br class='autobr' />
UIC is delighted to invite you to the UIC Serious Gaming Day which will be held on <strong>10 October in Vienna at RCG</strong>.</p>
<p>The highest environmental, quality and safety standards apply to the use of rail as a mode of transport. This means that a lot of training is requested from collaborators working in the sector. Most of the entrants in the sector are digital natives who are used to contemporary ways of absorbing new knowledge.</p>
<p>Serious gaming within the rail sector is an answer to these challenges. This seminar invites participants to familiarise themselves with the concepts. During this one-day seminar, you will be introduced to the theoretical concepts as you experience real-life cases in some concrete business games.</p>
<p><strong>Agenda</strong></p>
<p><strong>10:00: Welcome &amp; introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong>10:30: What is serious gaming?</strong></p>
<p><strong>11:00: First game: Food &amp; feed safety in the rail sector</strong></p>
<p>The game explains in a contemporary and fun way how rail can transport these goods as the most environmentally friendly mode of transport. Dispatching, wagon cleaning and operational aspects are explained in a non-academic way.</p>
<p><strong>12:00: Lunch</strong></p>
<p><strong>13:00 : Second game: Core cargo</strong></p>
<p>Experience the different actors involved in organising rail freight transport.</p>
<p><strong>15:00: Third game: Core Cargo 2.0</strong></p>
<p>A deep dive into operational rail dispatching.</p>
<p><strong>16:00 : Round-up &amp; next steps </strong></p>

        <texte><![CDATA[<p>The 3rd Rail Sustainability index data collection cycle kicked off on 5 July and will close on 30 September 2024. UIC members are invited to enter their sustainability achievements and contribution to seven key United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. A straightforward list of 43 key performance indicators is collected, benchmarked and each member receives their own score report and badge.</p>
<p><strong>Make it count!</strong></p>
<p>UIC members are invited to input their data for the period covering the years 2021 to 2023 through the Rail Sustainability index tool. <br class='autobr' />
To be part of this annual benchmark and report, members need to complete the report by 30 September 2024.</p>
<p>Individual scores will be calculated and given to each company at the end of this year. Each company which fills in the Rail Sustainability index will be attributed a label corresponding to its score on the tool.</p>
<p>“UIC members are invited to support this collective initiative to make rail’s sustainability credentials visible.”</p>
